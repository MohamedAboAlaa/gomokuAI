## üéÆ Game Overview

Gomoku is a two-player strategy board game played on a 15√ó15 grid. Players alternate placing stones (black and white) on empty intersections, with the goal of being the first to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## ü§ñ AI Features

### Core Algorithm
- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Strategic decision-making algorithm that evaluates all possible moves
- **Pattern Recognition**: Sophisticated evaluation system based on strategic formations
- **4-Level Deep Search**: Looks ahead 4 moves to anticipate consequences
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized to respond within 1-3 seconds per move

### Advanced Optimizations

1. **Boundary Optimization**
   - Reduces search space from 225 to ~20-30 relevant moves
   - 87% reduction in move consideration space
   - 7-11√ó faster search performance

2. **Transposition Table (Memoization)**
   - Zobrist hashing for efficient position lookup
   - 30-50% reduction in computation time
   - Avoids recalculating previously seen positions

3. **Move Ordering**
   - Examines promising moves first for better pruning
   - 50-75% reduction in nodes examined
   - Theoretical improvement to O(b^(d/2)) complexity

4. **Incremental Evaluation**
   - Only calculates value changes from new moves
   - 99% reduction in evaluation time per move
   - Efficient pattern-based scoring system

5. **Strategic Distant Monitoring**
   - Monitors potential threats developing away from main action
   - Prevents missing distant winning combinations
   - Throttled checks for optimal performance

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Time Complexity
- **Without Optimizations**: O(225^d) ‚âà 11.4 billion nodes at depth 3
- **With Optimizations**: O(20^(d/2)) ‚âà 894 nodes at depth 3
- **Overall Improvement**: 99.99992% reduction in nodes examined

### Benchmark Results
- **Depth 1**: ~0.24 seconds
- **Depth 2**: ~1.65 seconds  
- **Depth 3**: ~24.57 seconds (unoptimized)
- **Depth 4**: ~1-3 seconds (with all optimizations) ‚≠ê *Default*
- **Depth 5**: ~30+ seconds (with optimizations)

## üéØ Strategic Capabilities

### Pattern Recognition System
The AI evaluates positions using a sophisticated pattern dictionary:

- **Win Conditions** (Five in a row): 10,000,000 points
- **Immediate Threats** (Live Four): 1,000,000 points
- **Forcing Patterns** (Double Fours): 1,000,000 points
- **Strategic Patterns** (Live Three): 200,000 points
- **Defensive Patterns** (Block threats): -2,500,000 points
- **Transitional Patterns** (Two with potential): 1,000 points

### Game Stage Analysis
- **Early Game**: Fast decisions with optimal center opening
- **Mid Game**: Complex pattern evaluation with highest computation time
- **Late Game**: Efficient endgame calculation with reduced search space

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries: `math`, `random` (standard library)

### Installation
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd gomoku-ai
python gomoku.py
```

### Usage
```python
# Initialize the AI
ai = GomokuAI(depth=4)  # Default depth

# Make AI move
ai.ai_move()

# Check game result
result = ai.checkResult()
```

                    
## üí° Key Technical Insights

1. **Combined Optimizations**: Individual optimizations provide substantial benefits, but their combined effect transforms an impractical algorithm into a responsive game AI.

2. **Pattern-Based Evaluation**: Strategic formations are more important than simple stone counting, enabling the AI to recognize complex tactical situations.

3. **Balanced Performance**: The default depth of 4 represents an optimal balance between strategic strength and computational efficiency.

## üéÆ Gameplay Features

- **Opening Strategy**: Always plays optimally at center (7,7)
- **Defensive Capability**: Recognizes and blocks opponent threats
- **Offensive Tactics**: Creates advantageous patterns and winning combinations
- **Win Detection**: Correctly identifies and executes winning moves

## üìà Performance Visualization

The AI demonstrates consistent performance across different game stages:
- **Spatial Distribution**: Central moves require more computation than edge moves
- **Temporal Analysis**: Mid-game positions typically have highest computation requirements
- **Pruning Efficiency**: Alpha-beta pruning effectiveness varies with move ordering quality

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting AI Difficulty
```python
# Easier AI (faster, less strategic)
ai = GomokuAI(depth=2)

# Harder AI (slower, more strategic)
ai = GomokuAI(depth=5)  # Warning: 30+ seconds per move
```

### Pattern Weights
Modify the pattern dictionary in `utils.py` to adjust AI behavior and strategy priorities.
